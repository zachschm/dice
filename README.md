# dice

This is the first website I created with javascript. It is a very basic website that is a simple dice game between two players. Within the javascript, the Math functions random and floor were used to obtain a random dice value. The website makes use of six dice images; one representing each side of the die. Query selectors and innerHTML functions were used to alter our html image tags to modify which dice image is selected. Then, based on the results of the game, the website prints who wins the game.
